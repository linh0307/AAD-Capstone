# AAD-Capstone
The Android App Development Capstone MOOC
Presently, for posting marks and attendance, the concerned faculty has to login to the website, which might be quite a tedious job. In many schools, even the students have to log in to the website, which might take more time to load the entire data and be little inconvenient. Present proposal is an application that can be installed on android mobile phone, through which, faculty and students can login through their specified username and password and can directly update marks and attendances, from an android phone without logging into the website. This application will use content provider to get and update data.
